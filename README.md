# MyDbank

A decentralized Bank based on Smart Contracts made in Solidity and running on Ethereum Blockchain, for learning purpouses.
The proyect idea is based on this one from [Dapp University](https://github.com/dappuniversity/dbank).

## Install

```bash
npm install 
cd truffle
npm install # yes, there are two package.jsons, one for the frontend and another for truffle
```

## Compile and Migrate Smart Contracts

First, make sure you are running a local ERC20 blockchain, for example [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
Verify that the _development_ network configured in __truffle-config.js__ matches your params, else modify them. 
Then, just execute _truffle_ commands:

```bash
cd truffle/
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```

## Run Truffle Tests

```bash
truffle test
```

## Launch Frontend Application

Go back to the root of the proyect, if not already there, and run:

```bash
cd ..
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:4200

## Connect Metamask to one of the Ganache Accounts

- Make sure you are running Ganache. Then pick the first account and copy its private key.
- Go to http://localhost:4200
- On Metamask, add a new Network, with URL http://localhost, 7545 as port and chain ID 1337. Use this network for development.
- Also in Metamask import an account -> specify the private key you copied from the Ganache first account. __Warning__: do not use this account as a real account.
- Reload the webapp.
